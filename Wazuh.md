When you access the Wazuh dashboard for the first time, the browser shows a warning message stating that the certificate was not issued by a trusted authority. This is expected and the user has the option to accept the certificate as an exception or, alternatively, configure the system to use a certificate from a trusted authority.

Note You can find the passwords for all the Wazuh indexer and Wazuh API users in the wazuh-passwords.txt file inside wazuh-install-files.tar. To print them, run the following command:
```
sudo tar -O -xvf wazuh-install-files.tar wazuh-install-files/wazuh-passwords.txt
```
If you want to uninstall the Wazuh central components, run the Wazuh installation assistant using the option -u or â€“-uninstall.
